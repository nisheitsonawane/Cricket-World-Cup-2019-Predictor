    "## <p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">• In conclusion, in this project, I aimed to show how Machine Learning could be used to calculate probabilities of which team is most likely to win the 2019 world cup in a simulation, using machine learning techniques. The goal was to leverage historical data and team rankings to predict the outcomes of the tournament matches.</p>\n",
    "## <p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">• I started by collecting and preprocessing the necessary datasets, including past match results, team rankings, and fixture information. Through data exploration and cleaning, I ensured the data was in a suitable format for analysis.</p>\n",
    "## <p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">• Next, I applied machine learning algorithms, specifically a Random Forest Classifier, to train our prediction model. I used features such as team rankings, match venues, and other relevant factors to train the model on historical data.</p>\n",
    "## <p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">• After training the model, I evaluated its performance using a train-test split approach. The model achieved an accuracy of <b>approximately 69.8%</b> on the training set and <b>61.6%</b> on the test set. These results indicate that the model has learned patterns from the training data and can make reasonable predictions on unseen test data.</p>\n",
    "## <p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">• Using the trained model, I then made predictions for the group stage matches of the 2019 Cricket World Cup. I considered the teams' rankings and assigned the better-ranked team as 'Team_1' and the other team as 'Team_2' for each match. The model predicted the winning team for each match based on the trained patterns and provided insights into potential outcomes.</p>\n",
    "## <p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">• Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in predicting cricket match outcomes. I developed a prediction model that can provide valuable insights and aid in decision-making for the 2019 Cricket World Cup.</p>\n",
